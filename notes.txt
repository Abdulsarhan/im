we basically have this:


the reference pointers are stored in a pair that looks like so:
8 bits for uncompressed length, and 15 bits for distance
                               (this is why the sliding window is 2^15)

3.2.2. Use of Huffman coding in the "deflate" format

 The Huffman codes used for each alphabet in the "deflate"
 format have two additional rules:

     * All codes of a given bit length have lexicographically
       consecutive values, in the same order as the symbols
       they represent;

     * Shorter codes lexicographically precede longer codes.


 We could recode the example above to follow this rule as
 follows, assuming that the order of the alphabet is ABCD:

    Symbol  Code
    ------  ----
    A       10
    B       0
    C       110
    D       111

C and D have the same length, so the have to be lexicographically consecutive.


we basically have to do the following to decode a fixed hufman block:

read a bit from the input stream, compare the bit against the codes in the huffman tree.
if the value is less than 256, copy it.
if the value is 256, break out of the loop.
if the value is greater than 256, compute the distance.
